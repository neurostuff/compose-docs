        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to share the release of a significant new innovation in Neurosynth Compose: <strong>AI-Assisted Curation</strong>. This new feature aims to simplify and accelerate custom neuroimaging meta-analyses, making it easier than ever to curate a set of studies for inclusion into a quantitative meta-analysis.</p><p>Traditionally, reviewing studies for inclusion in a meta-analysis takes hundreds of hours, even with a user-friendly interface. The original Neurosynth platform helped by using text mining to group studies by keywords, but extracting crucial details—like participant demographics or task design—remained a challenge because such information is inconsistently reported.</p><p>With Large Language Models (LLMs) and zero-shot learning, we can now automatically extract structured study information directly from full-text articles. This a key step towards <strong>precise, automated neuroimaging meta-analysis</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="llms-for-neuroscientific-information-extraction"><strong>LLMs for Neuroscientific Information Extraction</strong><a href="#llms-for-neuroscientific-information-extraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to llms-for-neuroscientific-information-extraction" title="Direct link to llms-for-neuroscientific-information-extraction">​</a></h2><p>Historically, developing AI models for information extraction required a large number of annotated examples required for training, making it impossible to apply in low-data fields like neuroimaging. However, modern LLMs can interpret scientific text without extensive domain-specific training. It is now possible to  automatically extract information from articles, even in areas where there are very few existing human-labeled examples. This approach, called "<strong>zero-shot learning</strong>", means modern LLMs can extract information without task-specific training.</p><p>By prompting LLMs carefully, we can extract verifiable details—like sample size, diagnosis, age range, tasks, and modalities—from more than 30,000 studies in the NeuroStore database. These details are displayed during curation, making it easier to compare studies and decide which to include.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Figure 1" src="/compose-docs/assets/images/ai_extraction_workflow-a0d81fd1699210283087eba475584512.png" width="932" height="203" class="img_ev3q">

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello Neurosynth Users,</p><p>2023 was a very exciting year for Neurosynth, having launched our Compose platform to the public and announced it on social media.

Certain regions, such as the insula or lateral PFC for instance, play a very broad role in cognition, and hence are consistently activated for many different tasks and cognitive states. Using MKDA Chi-Squared, you can test if brain activity in a region (such as the insula) is specifically associated with the studies in your meta-analysis.</p><p>Previously association tests were available for the automatically generated maps on neurosynth.org. <strong>Now you can perform large-scale association tests for your custom meta-analyses in Neurosynth Compose.</strong></p><p>We have created a full primer and tutorial on MKDA Chi-Squared, including an example from a recent meta-analysis on social processing.

and streamline user interfaces. Automated meta-analyses are ideal for generating exploratory results rapidly, enabling meta-analysis as part of routine scientific practice.  </p><p>We've also made many small but important updates to our platform, including significant performance updates and improvements to the user interface.
<em>Neurosynth Compose</em> is now more intuitive and easier to use.

Early protypes to extract detailed information (such as participant demographics) from neuroimaging articles using LLMs
have shown promise. We are working on incorporating these workflows into <em>Neurosynth Compose</em>, making it even easier to identify relevant studies for meta-analysis.</li></ul><p>We look forward to your feedback!</p><p>-Alejandro</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dear Neurosynth Community,</p><p>My name is Alejandro, and I am the current project leader of the Neurosynth project.</p><p>I am very excited to announce to you that the Neurosynth project lives on, and we are officially announcing the (beta) release of the latest member of the ecosystem: Neurosynth Compose.</p><p><em>Neurosynth Compose</em> enables users to easily perform custom neuroimaging meta-analyses using a web-based platform, with no programming experience required. This project addresses one of the most commonly request features, which is the ability to customize large-scale meta-analyses using you own expert knowledge.</p><p><em>Neurosynth Compose</em> is <em>free to use</em> and helps users:</p><ul><li>🔎 <strong>Search</strong> across over 20,000 studies in the Neurosynth database, or import from external databses such as PubMed.</li><li>🗃️ <strong>Curate</strong> your StudySet using systematic review tools conforming to the <a href="https://www.prisma-statement.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PRISMA</a> guidelines.</li><li>📝 <strong>Extract</strong> coordinates and metadata for each study, leveraging thousands of pre-extracted studies to minimize effort.</li><li>📊 <strong>Analyze</strong> by specifying a reproducible <a href="https://readthedocs.org/projects/nimare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NiMARE</a> workflow, and execute it locally or in the cloud.</li><li>🔗 <strong>Share</strong> with the community with complete provenance and reproducibility.</li></ul><p>The goal of <em>Neurosynth Compose</em> is to enable researchers to go beyond the finite set of automatically generated meta-analyses from the original platform and overcome limitations from automated coordinate and semantic extraction. The end result is a gold standard meta-analysis, in much less time than a manual workflow, and with much greater reproducible. </p><p>Currently, <em>Neurosynth Compose</em> is in beta, and under active development. We welcome feedback to ensure our platform meets the needs of the community. Please leave us feedback using the button on the bottom right corner of the screen!</p><p>We are working on several upcoming features that will make the platform even better. Many of these features are already available in our Python meta-analysis library, NiMARE, and we are actively working on the user facing online interfaces.</p><ul><li><strong>Image-based Meta-Analysis (IBMA)</strong>. We have developed algorithms in NiMARE for using whole-brain statistical maps as inputs to meta-analysis. This is more powerful and sensitive technique compared to Coordinate-base Meta-Analysis. Soon, you will be able to use NeuroVault data as inputs for your meta-analyses.</li><li><strong>MKDA Chi-squared / Association test</strong>. A hallmark feature of Neurosynth is the ability to relate meta-analytic findings to the rest of the literature, to determine the strength and specificity of an association (this was previously called "reverse inference"). This will soon be possible on your custom meta-analyses.</li><li><strong>A wide range of improvements to the user experience</strong>.
